SHAKER INSTALLATION STEPS FOR THE DEMO EXAMPLE
==============================================

We are assuming that you already installed "mojito-shaker" npm package locally somewhere.
This steps are just to run the demo so you can investigate how shaker works in a running example.

1. Assuming you are in the folder where you first install "mojito-shaker", go to the demo app folder:
	$cd node_modules/mojito-shaker/examples/demo

2. Link the mojito-shaker binary within this folder:
	$ npm link mojito-shaker

3. Run the commnad for developer mode:
	$ mojito-shake --run

(4.) Run the command for "production like" mode:
	$ mojito-shake --context "environment:test" --run

Enjoy! :))
